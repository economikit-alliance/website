Sidâ€™s experience spans from heading South Asia's largest trading desk to exploring distributed economic paradigms in the Gandhi Ashram in India. He is the founder of [Sacred Capital](https://sacred.capital), a Singapore based organisation that has developed reputation infrastructure for [Neighbourhoods](https://neighbourhoods.network). He believes distributed technology is enabling new forms of social coordination that don't rely on consensus.
