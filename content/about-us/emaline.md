Emaline first became directly involved with Holochain and distributed computing while researching for her PhD dissertation entitled "Internet Addiction and Network Production: Subjectivity in the Age of Digital Capitalism". Since mid-2017 she has been supporting the Holo-verse with research and communications, advocating for the adoption of agent-centric and data-sovereign technologies. 

She comes to tech as a psychologist who graduated from the University of West Georgia in 2019. She works with Economikit and the [Commons Engine](https://commonsengine.org), where her interest in data ethics, commons-centric economics, and emerging forms of social organization continues to grow. She also writes about critical psychiatry and social justice in mental health contexts with [Mad in America Foundation](https://www.madinamerica.com/author/efriedman/). More writing, including a book in Routledge's Concepts in Critical Psychology [series](https://www.routledge.com/Concepts-for-Critical-Psychology/book-series/CONCEPTSCRIT), and activities may be found [here](https://herlinus.com).
