Lynn Foster and Bob Haugen live on the web at [mikorizal.org](http://mikorizal.org), and live for real in rural Wisconsin US, where we can live cheap and do what retired people everywhere should be able to do â€“ what we want!

What we want is to use the knowledge we have (like 4+ decades each of economic software development experience) to help groups bravely organizing fair and sustainable economic experiments on the ground. And hopefully to help these groups network into whole new economies and new relationships.  Bob blogs about economic networks [here](https://write.as/economic-networks/archive).

We got interested in Holochain because we saw the limitations of heavyweight blockchains, and noticed that Holo was doing REA without knowing it. We have worked with REA more than 20 years, so we are helping them do it on purpose via hREA and Valueflows.
