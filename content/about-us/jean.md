Jean M Russell hacks social technology (software, hardware, and wetware), aiming toward more ethical social organisms. Jean moonlights as a currency designer, participatory process facilitor, and maven midwife of the living edge of Thrivability. 

Jean functioned as project lead for the *Holo* ICO, which raised 30,000 ETH (valued at $22M at that time).

In 2016 with Herman Wagter, she published *[Cultivating Flows](https://www.cultivatingflows.com/): How Ideas Become Thriving Organizations*, which explored, through leading edge practitioners, what patterns enable healthy emergence.
