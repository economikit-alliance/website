pospi is an idealist by fate; distributed systems engineer by trade; accidental economist and sociologist; and recovering technologist, futurist and entrepreneur. After attempting to make social media meaningful at an early age, co-launching a startup to "fix charity" and designing economic systems to "solve climate change" with blockchain; they have finally arrived at the only conclusions possible. That the advances afforded by technological systems have mostly only ever caused vast harms to many, that entrepreneurial framings tied into market-based solutionism and the logics of individualism ultimately corrupt efforts toward change, and that the implied power dynamics of aid relations and vaunted intellectual status of individuals in STEM fields often acts against the interests of those we aim to help.

In recent years a mix of interest, hope and skepticism toward Holochain as a technological enabler lead them to seek perspective outside of the tech industry's thought bubble. They have been privileged to make themselves a home here alongside the sociologists, linguists, gender theorists, cultural anthropologists, Ghandian ethicists and community psychologists who form this collective. 

pospi still works to create software and governance tools in service to community autonomy, resilience and socio-economic empowerment; and has begun exploring intersections between data, algorithmic, economic and Indigenous sovereignty movements.

They occasionally write on alternative economics, decentralisation, decolonisation, anti-racism, social change, surveillance and privacy at [pospi.spadgos.com](http://pospi.spadgos.com/) and on [Scuttlebutt](https://scuttlebutt.nz/)\*, tweet things at [@pospigos](https://twitter.com/pospigos) and can be found as 'pospi' basically wherever else they exist on the internet.
