# What we are creating

We build tools which provision for the necessities of life whilst making possible complex cross-cultural intersections and humane and vibrant modes of relating, exchanging, and caring for self, other, and community.

## Tools for economic autonomy

A new sociopolitical order needs a new measurement system. The ValueFlows protocol reimagines accounting as a rich multidimensional weave of attributable information that can be deeply representative of reality, whilst GraphQL brings these possibilities to the next generation of distributed computing.

Modular building blocks for the P2P economy&mdash; built to deploy fractally composable, off-grid capable, autonomous social, economic and resource coordination spaces of any scope and scale.

What is an economic system without an interface? ValueFlows UI packages zero-dependency, zero-configuration building blocks for socioeconomic applications which work atop hREA, [Bonfire](https://bonfirenetworks.org/) and any other system implementing the ValueFlows protocol.

## Tools for social autonomy

An over-arching design principle for the distributed economy. 'Neighbourhoods' offers a new way to think about organising network of people and resources. By articulating 'specific culture' using 'generic tools' communities, apps and micro-networks build contextual pathways for the flow of capital and content.

Reputation Infrastructure for the distributed economy. Sacred Capital is building a formal language for cultural articulation, coupled with a *Reputation Interchange* that enables agents to port reputation data across contexts. By activating scalable reputation currencies, they hope to build a multi-dimensional wealth system in the long term.

## "The Kit"

The journey toward a thriving future is long and unknowable. Our work in how we relate, who seeks us out and what we do together is to humbly make the creation of our own digital and economic freedoms accessible to all.

We seek to make the organisation the kit, and the kit the organisation. To create artifacts through our lived experience and the guidance of others which empower groups of all kinds in radical and emancipatory ways.
